## ⚡ Quick Snapshot

- 👯 Open to: collaboration on open-source projects, mentorship, and interesting startup ideas.
- 💬 Ask me about: backend systems, APIs, automation, and clean architecture.
- 🧠 Fun fact: I sketch architecture diagrams more than I sketch on paper — purely digital art.

## 💬 How I Work
- I prefer small, iterative steps — ship often, learn fast.
- Tests and automation are non-negotiable.
- I document intent, not just the code — context saves time.
- Empathy first: teammates > ego.

## 🎯 Final note — a tiny manifesto
Code is my craft; clarity is my compass. I build with the future in mind and the human in my heart. If what I build makes someone's day a little easier — then it's worth the late nights.

Let's create something that matters. 🚀

If you'd like, I can:
- Personalize the README with your real projects, links, and emojis.
- Generate a shorter "business-card" version.
- Add animated SVGs and badges tuned to your exact stack.

Tell me which repositories to highlight or give me 3 sentences about yourself and I'll tailor this README to sound exactly like you.
